Accounts and Permissions
========================

This section will detail basic processing concerning user accounts and permissions.

User Addition
--------------

1. Users submit a request for access through the website using their email, and an account is registered for them automatically.
2. If approved by an admin, an AWS IAM account is created and associated with the user.

  1. *Users must be also associated with a group, which determine their access to analyses.*
  2. Users' AWS credential request status is designated as 'Completed,' 'Pending,' or 'Denied.' Currently the user is unable to view this designation.
  
3. Users then use these IAM credentials to login to the site and perform analyses

  1. Users may also optionally add their name to their account details.
